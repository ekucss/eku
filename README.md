# Eku

A friendly, light and simple style library

## Usage

To use the [eku](https://github.com/ekucss/eku) library, you must link in the `head` section of your HTML page the link below.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/eku@latest/css/eku.css" />
```

Also, you can use the minified version too, but it doesnt have source map, is only for production or optimization porpuses.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/eku@latest/css/eku.min.css" />
```

If you have a `Node.js` project, you can install it from `npm` using the next command.

```
npm i eku
yarn add eku
```
