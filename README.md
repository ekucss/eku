# Eku

Eku is a friendly, lightful and highly customizable css library to make modern and beaty web pages, applications and so much more; using the latest modern utilities to save time and apply useful styles.

## Usage

To use the [eku](https://github.com/ekucss/eku) library, you must link in the `head` section of your HTML page the link below.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/eku@latest/css/eku.css" />
```

Also, you can use the minified version, but it doesnt have a source map, is only for **production** or optimization purposes.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/eku@latest/css/eku.min.css" />
```

If you have a `Node.js` project, you can install it from `npm` or `yarn` using the commands below.

```
npm i eku
yarn add eku
```

## Themes

This is under development yet, but you can use the [create-eku-theme](https://github.com/adwher/create-eku-theme) initializer to customize the library.
