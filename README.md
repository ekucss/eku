Eku is a friendly, lightful and highly customizable css library to make modern and beaty web pages, applications and so much more; using the latest modern utilities to save time and apply useful styles.

Also, you can use the minified version, but it doesnt have a source map, is only for **production** or optimization purposes.

If you have a `Node.js` project, you can install it from `npm` or `yarn` using the commands below.
